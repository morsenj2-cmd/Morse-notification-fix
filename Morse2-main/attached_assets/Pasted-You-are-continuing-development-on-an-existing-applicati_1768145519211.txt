You are continuing development on an existing application.
Do not redesign UI, restructure pages, or refactor architecture unless required for correctness.

This prompt exists only to re-anchor the system around the tag-based logic, which is foundational and must not be weakened or bypassed.

CORE REMINDER — TAGS ARE THE SYSTEM

Tags are not a feature.
Tags are the underlying graph of the platform.

Every user, post, community, broadcast, launch, and recommendation must reference tags

Tags are mandatory system metadata

Tags are never visible to other users

Tags never block access; they influence ranking, relevance, and targeting

REQUIRED TAG ATTACHMENT (NO EXCEPTIONS)

Ensure the following entities always store and use tags:

Users (selected at onboarding)

Posts (global + community)

Communities (subs)

Broadcasts

Product / project launches

Search queries (when applicable)

If any of these can exist without tags, that is a bug.

TAG-DRIVEN BEHAVIOR (RE-VERIFY)
Feeds

Rank content higher when tag overlap with the viewer is higher

Do not hard-filter content

Maintain mixed feeds with weighted ordering

Search

Tags outweigh text descriptions

Results sorted by tag relevance score

Name matches still allowed but ranked below strong tag matches

Communities

Automated join invitations based on tag overlap

Community discovery ranking powered by tags

Profiles

Profile discovery driven by tag similarity

Tags remain hidden in UI

BROADCAST TAG ENFORCEMENT

Broadcasts must require tags

Broadcast tags are private and invisible

Recipient eligibility must match broadcast tags

Broadcasts must never ignore tag matching even if connection degree matches

POSTING CONTEXT TAG CHECK

Global posts require tags and must respect professional-content rules

Community posts require tags but allow memes

Meme warning system must not bypass tag logic

DATA & INDEXING CHECK

Ensure tags are:

Indexed

Normalized

Query-efficient

No duplicated or free-text-only tag storage

No hardcoded tag lists without extensibility

FAILURE CONDITIONS

Treat the following as blocking issues:

Any feed not using tags

Any recommendation ignoring tags

Any broadcast sent without tag matching

Any entity created without tags

Tags exposed in UI

FINAL DIRECTIVE

Do not add new features.
Do not change UX.
Do not simplify tag logic.

Preserve and enforce the tag-based system exactly as specified.
